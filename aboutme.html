									So who am I?
								</p>
								<p><span class="image right" style="max-width: 25%;"><img src="images/me.png" alt="" /></span>
									My name is John Gonzalez. I was born and raised in Southern California. My hobbies include reading, coding, playing the guitar, cooking, and learning languages. 
									Ever since I was little, I had this fascination with learning. It seemed like every other week I was trying to learn something new, whether it be learning how to solve a Rubik's cube or learning random facts about dinosaurs.
								</p>
								<p>
									Data science was not the career path I expected. I was majoring in physics when I began attending university, but I quickly learned that it was not the right path for me. 
									I did not have the passion I thought I did for the subject, and my grades reflected that. I began exploring other fields and I came across philosophy. 
									I enjoyed the subject, so I took more courses and eventually was enrolled in a philosophy of logic course.
								</p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/python.png" alt="" /></span>
									It was in that course where I realized that I might enjoy coding. If you've never seen logic questions before, they kind of look like (A v B) â†’ C. 
									For me, each question seemed like a puzzle that needed to be solved, and man do I like puzzles. I made a friend in that course that was studying computer science, and he commented to me that I might like coding if I enjoyed working on those questions.
								</p>
								<p>
									I took him up on his recommendation and took my first Python course shortly after. It turns out my friend was correct because I was hooked after that course. 
									I majored in cognitive science, which is an interdisciplinary study of the brain, and I specialized in machine learning. Because of my specialization, I was introduced to the data science field.
